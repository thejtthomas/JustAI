Legal advice: If you are seeking a divorce, it is an actual legal issue that can be resolved through the legal process. However, it is important to consult with a lawyer to understand the specific requirements and procedures in your jurisdiction.

Steps for registering complaint:

1. Consult with a family law attorney: Schedule a meeting with a family law attorney to discuss your situation, understand the legal process, and gather necessary information and documentation for filing a divorce petition.

2. Prepare the divorce petition: With the help of your attorney, prepare a divorce petition that includes details about the marriage, grounds for divorce, and requested relief (such as property division, child custody, or spousal support).

3. File the divorce petition: The completed divorce petition should be filed in the appropriate family court. Pay the required filing fee and submit the necessary documents as per the court's instructions.

4. Serve the divorce petition: Serve a copy of the divorce petition to your spouse, following the legal requirements for service in your jurisdiction. This could be done through a professional process server or as directed by the court.

5. Participation in court process: Attend all scheduled court hearings and proceedings related to your divorce case. Cooperate with your attorney and provide any additional information or documentation as required by the court.

6. Resolution or trial: Depending on the circumstances, your divorce case may be resolved through negotiation, mediation, or other alternative dispute resolution methods. If an agreement cannot be reached, a trial may be necessary to resolve the outstanding issues.

7. Finalize the divorce: Once the court has made its final decision on the issues, a divorce decree or judgment of dissolution will be issued. Follow the court's instructions to finalize the divorce and ensure compliance with any orders or agreements.
